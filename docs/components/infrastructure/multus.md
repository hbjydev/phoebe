# Multus CNI

[Multus CNI](https://github.com/k8snetworkplumbingwg/multus-cni) is a 'CNI
meta-plugin' to attach multiple network interfaces to pods in Kubernetes.

Its main function within Phoebe is to connect some of my services either to my
IoT VLAN or my VPN VLAN, helping to keep my workloads more secure.
