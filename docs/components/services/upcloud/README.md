# UpCloud

[UpCloud](https://upcloud.com) are a Finland-based cloud service provider that
provide a multitude of different types of resources.

I chose UpCloud as my cloud provider because of their home country, Finland,
being in the EU, which means I can enjoy the benefits of things like easier GDPR
processes and lower costs than if I were to use a US-based cloud like AWS or
GCP.

    I also use UpCloud for Object Storage, which is primarily used by a couple
    of my more fault-intolerant apps, like my ATProto PDS, as well as for
    archival storage for backups.
